# SPCC_Codes

This repository contains the contents of my `src/` folder of the `SPCC_Codes` Idea project folder. So, if you want to run these, you'll need to clone this repo _inside_ your `src/` folder.

I didn't feel like there was any need to commit my entire project folder, as this is a collection of small files and not a singular project.
